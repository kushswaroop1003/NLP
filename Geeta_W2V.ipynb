Just  like  a  servant,  one  should  act  fully  under  the  direction  of  the\\nSupreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the\\norder  of  the  master.  A  servant  acting  on  behalf  of  the  supreme  master  is\\nunaffected by profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms\\nof  the  order  of  the  Lord.  Now,  one  may  argue  that  Arjuna  was  acting  under\\nthe personal direction of Kåñëa but when Kåñëa is not present how should one\\nact?  If  one  acts  according  to  the  direction  of  Kåñëa  in  this  book,  as  well  as\\nunder the guidance of the representative of Kåñëa, then the result will be the\\nsame. The Sanskrit word mat-paraù is very important in this verse. It indicates\\nthat one has no goal in life save and except acting in Kåñëa consciousness just\\nto  satisfy  Kåñëa.  And  while  working  in  that  way,  one  should  think  of  Kåñëa\\nonly: “I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by Kåñëa.” While\\nacting in such a way, one naturally has to think of Kåñëa. This is perfect Kåñëa\\nconsciousness.  One  should,  however,  note  that  after  doing  something\\nwhimsically  he  should  not  offer  the  result  to  the  Supreme  Lord.  That  sort  of\\nduty  is  not  in  the  devotional  service  of  Kåñëa  consciousness.  One  should  act\\naccording to the order of Kåñëa. This is a very important point. That order of\\nKåñëa comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master.\\nTherefore the spiritual master’s order should be taken as the prime duty of life.\\nIf one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then\\none’s perfection of life in Kåñëa consciousness is guaranteed.\\n'>\n",

Lord  Kåñëa  instructed  that  the\\nindividual  is  not  all  in  all.  The  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead,  or  He\\nHimself, Kåñëa, as the localized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living\\nbeing.  After  changing  bodies,  the  living entity forgets his past deeds, but the\\nSupersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness\\nof all his activities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by\\nthis  Supersoul.  The  living  entity  gets  what  he  deserves  and  is  carried  by  the\\nmaterial body, which is created in the material energy under the direction of\\nthe Supersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body,\\nhe  has  to  work  under  the  spell  of  that  bodily  situation.  A  person  seated  in  a\\nhigh-speed  motorcar  goes  faster  than  one  seated  in  a  slower  car,  though  the\\nliving  entities,  the  drivers,  may  be  the  same.  Similarly,  by  the  order  of  the\\nSupreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular\\ntype  of  living  entity  so  that  he  may  work  according  to  his  past  desires.  The\\nliving entity is not independent. One should not think himself independent of\\nthe  Supreme  Personality  of  Godhead.  The  individual  is  always  under  the\\nLord’s control. Therefore one’s duty is to surrender, and that is the injunction\\nof the next verse.\\n'>\n",

The living\\nentity’s  constitutional  position  is  to  be  a  servitor;  he  has  to  serve  either  the\\nillusory mäyä or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his\\nnormal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then\\ncertainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this\\nmaterial world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as\\nthe master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his\\nillusion  is  over,  and  he  voluntarily  surrenders  unto  the  Supreme  to  act\\naccording  to  His  desires.  The  last  illusion,  the  last  snare  of  mäyä  to  trap  the\\nliving entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he\\nis  no  longer  a  conditioned  soul,  but  God.  He  is  so  unintelligent  that  he  does\\nnot think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does\\nnot consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from\\nthe  illusory  energy  is  to  understand  Kåñëa,  the  Supreme  Personality  of\\nGodhead, and agree to act according to His order.\\n'>\n",
